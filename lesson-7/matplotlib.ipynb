    "As we're now familiar with some of the features of [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/), we will wade into visualizing our data in Python using the built-in plotting options available directly in pandas. Much like the case of pandas being built upon [NumPy](https://numpy.org/), plotting in pandas takes advantage of plotting features from the [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) plotting library. Plotting in pandas provides a basic framework for visualizing our data, but as you'll see we will sometimes need to also use features from Matplotlib to enhance our plots. In particular, we will use features from the the `pyplot` module in Matplotlib, which provides [MATLAB](https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab.html)-like plotting.\n",

Bar plots are one option, which can be used quite similarly to line plots with the addition of the `kind=bar` parameter. Note that it is easiest to plot our selected time range for a bar plot by selecting the dates in our data series first, rather than adjusting the plot limits. pandas sees bar plot data as categorical, so the date range is more difficult to define for x-axis limits. For the y-axis, we can still define its range using the `ylim=[ymin, ymax]` parameter.

And as you can see, hvPlot makes it very easy to start creating your own interactive plots from pandas DataFrames.\n",
